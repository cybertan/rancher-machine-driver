Rancher-Machine-Drivers

For supporting Aliyun,I change the driver's name from "docker-machine-driver-aliyunecs_linux-amd64.tgz" to "docker-machine-driver-aliyunecs".
And use rancher-server download machine-driver from this registry.

For supporting XenServer,I change the driver's name from "docker-machine-driver-xenserver_linux-amd64.tgz" to "docker-machine-driver-xenserver".
And use rancher-server download machine-driver from this registry.
